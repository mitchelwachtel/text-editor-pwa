### Description

This is a full stack application using the MySQL database, node, express, and handlebars to generate HTML. This app allows users to have authenticated logins to post blogs and comment on others' blogs. Users are only able to edit and delete their own blog posts and comments. Users will have a different experience right from the homepage if not logged in. Right on the homepage, users will get more information about each blog post (date created and username of the writer) if logged in.
